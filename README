This charm deploys http://opentsdb.net from its git repository, on top of a
juju provided hbase cluster.

To use it, you need to deploy an hbase cluster, create a relation between the hbase quorum zookeeper and opentsdb and finally expose opentsdb.

For instance (using the example-hadoop.yaml included with this charm)::
juju deploy hbase hbase-master
juju deploy hbase hbase-regioncluster-01
juju deploy zookeeper hbase-zookeeper
juju add-relation hbase-master hbase-zookeeper
juju add-relation hbase-regioncluster-01 hbase-zookeeper
juju deploy --config example-hadoop.yaml hadoop hdfs-namenode
juju deploy --config example-hadoop.yaml hadoop hdfs-datacluster-01
juju add-relation hdfs-namenode:namenode hdfs-datacluster-01:datanode
juju add-relation hdfs-namenode:namenode hbase-master:namenode
juju add-relation hdfs-namenode:namenode hbase-regioncluster-01:namenode
juju add-relation hbase-master:master hbase-regioncluster-01:regionserver
# XXX: Here, you need to manually create the schema from a hbase node. e.g.
juju ssh hbase-master/0
exec hbase shell <<EOF
  create 'tsdb-uid',
      {NAME => 'id', COMPRESSION => 'NONE'},
      {NAME => 'name', COMPRESSION => 'NONE'}

  create 'tsdb',
    {NAME => 't', VERSIONS => 1, COMPRESSION => 'NONE', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW'}
EOF
juju deploy opentsdb
juju add-relation opentsdb hbase-zookeeper
juju expose opentsdb

Once that is done, you can use juju ssh to shell in and run more commands.
opentsdb is installed in /opt/opentsdb, and started and stopped via
start-stop-daemon by Juju itself. See the zookeeper-relation-changed hook for
more information.

You can put apache or haproxy in front of opentsdb - it exports the http interface.
